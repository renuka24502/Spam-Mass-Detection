/** Performs breadth-firsts visits of a graph exploiting multicore parallelism.
 * 
 * <p>To use this class you first create an instance, and then invoke {@link #visit(int)}. If you want perform
 * more visits preserving the {@link #marker} state you can invoke {@link #visit(int)} again. 
 * By calling {@link #clear()}, instead, you can reset {@link #marker} (i.e., forget about visited nodes).
 * 
 * <p>Alternatively, {@link #visitAll()} will start a visit from all the nodes of the graph in a more efficient way.
 * 
 * <p>After the visit, you can peek at the field {@link #marker} to discover details about the visit.
 * Depending on the {@link #parent} value provided at construction time, the array {@link #marker}
 * will be filled with parent information (e.g., with the index
 * of the parent node in the visit tree) or with a <em>{@linkplain #round round number}</em> increased at each nonempty visit, 
 * which act as a connected-component index if the graph is symmetric.
 *
 * <p>Observe that in the former case (if {@link #parent} is <code>true</code>), the array {@link #marker} will
 * contain the value -1 for the nodes that have not been reached by the visit, the parent of the node in the BFS tree
 * if the node was not the root, or the node itself for the root.
 * 
 * <p>In the case of {@link #visit(int, int)}, {@link #queue} and {@link #cutPoints}, too, provide useful information. In 
 * particular, the nodes in {@link #queue} from the <var>d</var>-th to the (<var>d</var>&nbsp;+1)-th cutpoint
 * are exactly the nodes at distance <var>d</var> from the source.
 *
 * <h2>Performance issues</h2>
 * 
 * <p>This class needs three integers per node. 
 * If there are several available cores, breadth-first visits will be <em>decomposed</em> into relatively
 * small tasks (small blocks of nodes in the queue at the same distance from the starting node) 
 * and each task will be assigned to the first available core. Since all tasks are completely
 * independent, this ensures a very high degree of parallelism. However, on very sparse graphs the cost
 * of keeping the threads synchronised can be extremely high, and even end up <em>increasing</em> the visit time.
 * 
 * <p>Note that if the degree distribution is extremely skewed some cores might get stuck
 * in the enumeration of the successors of some nodes with a very high degree.
